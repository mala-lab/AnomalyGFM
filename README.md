Official PyTorch implementation of "AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection".

> 1️⃣ AnomalyGFM is the **first** GAD-oriented GFM with strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities. 

> 2️⃣ A comprehensive benchmark on both zero-shot and few-shot settings using 11 real-world GAD datasets is established, on which i) AnomalyGFM performs significantly
better the state-of-the-art unsupervised, supervised, and generalist GAD methods, and ii) AnomalyGFM can scale up to very large graphs





The datasets after feature alignment can be obtained from   [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SSWgFRdth3U44_IMRnW775B1l-bjQATW?usp=sharing). 

The code for AnomalyGFM and the adaptation to the baseline will be uploaded soon.
