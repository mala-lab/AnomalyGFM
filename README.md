> 1Ô∏è‚É£ AnomalyGFM is the **first** GAD-oriented GFM with strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities. 

> 2Ô∏è‚É£ AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to learn discriminative, graph-agnostic class prototypes with normal and abnormal residual features, and it supports few-shot graph prompt tuning for better adaptation.

> 3Ô∏è‚É£ A comprehensive benchmark on both zero-shot and few-shot settings using 11 real-world GAD datasets is established, on which i) AnomalyGFM performs significantly
better the state-of-the-art unsupervised, supervised, and generalist GAD methods, and ii) AnomalyGFM can scale up to very large graphs

The GAD datasets after feature alignment can be obtained from   [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SSWgFRdth3U44_IMRnW775B1l-bjQATW?usp=sharing). 

The code for  both AnomalyGFM and the adaptation to the baseline methods will be uploaded in this week.
